    <h2>Breaking Into Industry.</h2>
    <p>Breaking into a new industry can be a daunting task, and for many, it's the scariest part of pursuing a dream career. The uncertainty, competition, and sheer amount of unknowns can be overwhelming, leaving many feeling stuck and unsure of where to start.</p>
    <br><p>One of the biggest challenges of getting into a new industry is the lack of experience and connections. Many industries require a certain level of expertise and networking, which can be difficult to acquire without prior experience. This creates a catch-22 situation where <strong>you're expected to have experience to get hired, but you can't get experience without being hired.</strong></p>
    <P>Moreover, the job market is constantly evolving, and industries are becoming increasingly specialized. <b> This means that even if you have experience in one area, it may not be directly applicable to another.</b> The stakes are high, and the pressure to succeed can be intense.
